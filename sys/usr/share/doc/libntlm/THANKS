Much of the code was originally written by Andrew Tridgell for the
Samba project.  Frediano Ziglio contributed rewritten files, so the
library could be released under LGPL instead of GPL.  The MD4 and DES
implementation was replaced by the Gnulib LGPL copy, contributed by
Simon Josefsson.

Bug reports, patches and/or suggestions were also received from:

David Leonard <davidl@vintela.com>
Matthias Andree <matthias.andree@gmx.de>
Pavel Fedin <fedin@matek.ru>
