# ___WinSNPGT: Genotyping of specified SNP sites on windows system___

## 💡 General Introduction
The rapid development of sequencing technology and dramatic drop in the cost have led to the generation of massive amounts of data. However, most of the raw data are analyzed on linux systems, and the process of generating variant loci information from sequencing data is a challenge for researchers unfamiliar with linux systems. We have developed a small program to call variant loci on the windows system, WinSNPGT. It can obtain the genotypes of the raw sequencing data for the snp loci specified in our datasets. The installation and use of this program is described below.

## 🔍 Change Log
- [Version 1.0](https://github.com/JessieChen7/WinSNPGT) -First version released on January, 1st, 2023

## 🧾 Background
We have developed a phenotype prediction platform, **[CropGStools](http://iagr.genomics.cn/)**, which contains multiple high-quality datasets from important crops such as rice, maize and so on. These datasets were used as training sets to build models for phenotype prediction. Users can upload genotypes of their own samples to the platform for online phenotype prediction.

The WinSNPGT program was developed to ensure that the genotypes uploaded by users match those in the training set for modeling so that bias in the prediction results can be avoided. Users can run this program on the windows system to realize the whole process from sequencing files to getting genotypes by simple operation, which is very friendly for people who have little experience in linux operation.
